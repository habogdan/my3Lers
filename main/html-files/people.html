                    As her impressively diverse list of credits attests, the beautiful Canadian-born Katheryn Winnick
                    has always been drawn to the unconventional, showing range and depth with every role she plays.
                    Winnick will next star as the fearless shield maiden, 'Lagertha', wife and warrior of a great
                    Viking leader in the new eagerly-anticipated television series "Vikings". Produced by MGM and
                    The History Channel, "Vikings" is an epic historical drama that chronicles legendary events of
                    the medieval times, also starring Golden Globe Winner, Gabriel Byrne and Travis Fimmel. Winnick
                    considers "Vikings" to be her most precious acting memories to date. This year alone, Winnick
                    exemplifies her talent and diversity in roles when she appears as Charlie Sheen's ex in
                    "A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III" (co starring Bill Murray, Patricia Arquette,
                    and Jason Schwartzman); and alongside Al Pacino, Christopher Walken, and Alan Arkin in Lakeshore
                    Entertainment's "Stand Up Guys".
